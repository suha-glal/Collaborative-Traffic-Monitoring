# Collaborative Traffic Monitoring 
This project shows the utilization of GPS-equipped mobile phones to automatically share their location and speed data while driving on the roads. The data is collected by a central service from all participating vehicles and is continuously processed in order to infer the traffic flow. The output will be displayed on Google maps with color-coding on streets reflecting the traffic conditions and speed of flow on individual streets. The displayed maps convey real-time traffic information on demand in a usable way to drivers. 
This novel approach is collaborative, which means it depends on collective participation from a representative sample of road vehicles. This collective participation is very realistic given the advances in smart phone technologies and the fact that many of the mobile phones that are currently sold are equipped with built-in GPS devices in addition to unlimited Internet connection packages. Additionally, users have a great incentive to participate in such a service as they will be able to obtain real-time traffic information, and the more they participate the more accurate this information will be.
